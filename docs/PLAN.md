# BillBack plan (from 2026-10-25)

Working branch: `after-david-takeover`. Backup of everything before: `pre-david-work`. `master` on GitHub is
left exactly as submitted (6 PM deadline, history cleaned for judging) until Gavin says otherwise. Push new
work to `after-david-takeover`, never to `master`.

## Decisions

**Focus:** the main user flow only: the case page (find the mistakes → approve → call → outcome) and the
Cases list (follow-ups). Hospitals and Under the hood stay as they are; improve later.

**Not a black box:** every check an app agent runs, and every finding with its proof and money saved, must
show up on the case page as it happens.

**Two money-checking app agents**, run in parallel in the Review step:

| App agent | Covers | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Nessie agent (today's Auditor) | The patient's own records: bank (Nessie), bill, insurance statement | missed payments, duplicate bank charges, bill vs insurance statement, duplicate lines on the bill |
| Bright Data agent (today's Policy agent) | Public rules and data: hospital policy, state law, price files | charity care / discounts, payment-plan rules, price check against the hospital's real prices |

The design audit (`docs/ideas-backlog.md`) found nothing that needs a third agent.

**Real data first, mock only where we must.** Real hospital prices, real policies, real laws. The patient,
bank history and insurer stay synthetic.

## Rough version (build now, in order)

1. **Fold New case into Cases.** Cases is home, with a "+ New case" button that opens the chat intake. With
   no cases yet, go straight to the chat. Top bar: Cases · Hospitals · Under the hood.
2. **Shared format for the two app agents.** One shape for what each agent reports: steps (label, status,
   result) and findings (what was found, money saved, proof, source). Both agents and the UI use it.
3. **Generic Review screen.** The case page shows a live panel for each app agent that reports in, not
   hard-coded Auditor/Policy columns. Findings feed the "ranked by money saved" list.
4. **Nessie agent:** fix the loose payment match first (any word like "Medical"/"Pacific" in a merchant name
   counts as a payment to the hospital, and there's no date check: `finance._matches_payee`).
5. **Bright Data agent: real prices.** Rebuild Rosa's bill from CPMC's real price file and add a price
   check against it, plus a duplicate-line check on the bill. Update her numbers everywhere they appear
   (insurance statement, demo PDFs, replays, pitch).

Steps 4 and 5 can run as two coding agents in parallel, each on its own branch.

## Later (when there's time)

From the audit, roughly in priority order. Details and sources are in `docs/ideas-backlog.md`.
- Collections and credit-report law check (California: no credit reporting, no lawsuit before day 180,
  application must come with collection notices). Rosa's "final notice" makes it a strong demo moment.
- Split "$7,600 insurance" into the two real errors: $3,660 paid but not credited, $3,940 network discount.
- 12-month medical spending from the bank for the high-medical-cost write-off (today only this bill counts).
- Medicare-rate cap for low-income/uninsured patients (also unlocks Chinese Hospital's "% of Medicare" tiers).
- Insurance status is guessed (`insured=bool(eob)`); 2025 poverty-line figures → 2026.
- Say in the UI that the plan's "under 4% of income" cap is our choice, not the hospital's policy or law.
- SF General has no discount tiers in the policy DB, so it always says "no discount".
- Verify before showing anything legal: 501(r) for UCSF/SF General, NCCI on facility claims, 180-day
  appeal window, California itemized-bill rule, Marcus's Medi-Cal eligibility.
- Roadmap (pitch only): the separate ER physician bill (No Surprises Act), insurance-denial appeals.

## Data on hand

Real price files (downloaded with plain HTTPS from each hospital's `cms-hpt.txt`), kept out of git in
`data/price_files/`: `cpmc.csv` (CPMC Van Ness, 16.9 MB, CMS template v3.0.0) and `chinese.csv` (46 MB).
UCSF's is a 91 MB JSON on Box (not downloaded); SF General's is a 3.9 MB CSV (not downloaded).
